It is 2025 December!
Currently persuing Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering.
today ,i earn a difference from a client, from whome i didn't expected in return .
i am willing to do that work so i did.
After completing the task.
when i was leaving he payed me 100 RS even when i refused and asked to take it's half.
in return he said , "if you wouldn't do it , i have to go to khandwa city and arrange a technician who can charged more than that.
".
So i take the earning.
and thought that same applies for the freelancing.
if we can solve any problem of someone { client \ companies } , they can willing to pay as more as it can.
Becouse we can save them from trouble, and loss.

thats why many companies pay millions to a Developer , as Developer cut down the cost.

It is the case when client or needy found me. It is rare they can pay you.
So, it is our duty to solve ones's problem and save him from trouble thus he/she can willing to pay you without any pressure!/
